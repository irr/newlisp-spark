# Architecture: Direct-Threaded Bytecode Virtual Machine, Tail Call Optimization & Generational GC

## 1. Overview

This document describes the design, implementation, and safety mechanisms of the high-performance execution engine introduced to newLISP Spark.

The enhanced engine combines three core architectural pillars:
1. **Direct-Threaded Bytecode Virtual Machine (`nl-vm.c`, `nl-vm.h`)**: Compiles lambda abstract syntax trees (ASTs) into compact linear bytecode executed by a computed-goto dispatch loop, eliminating tree-walking overhead and C stack recursion.
2. **Full Tail Call Optimization (TCO) (`nl-vm.c`, `nl-vm.h`)**: Detects tail positions across all control-flow forms and reuses execution frames in-place (`OP_TAIL_CALL_SELF`, `OP_TAIL_CALL`), guaranteeing strict $O(1)$ stack space for deep and infinite recursions.
3. **Generational Garbage Collector (`newlisp.c`, `newlisp.h`)**: Implements a 64 MB Gen 0 bump-allocated nursery for transient cell allocation and Cheney-style copy-evacuation into a tenured Gen 1 generation during collections.

## 2. Direct-Threaded Bytecode Virtual Machine

### 2.1 Instruction Set Architecture

The bytecode VM uses 8-bit opcodes (`uint8_t`) with variable-length operand encodings for optimal cache locality:

| Opcode Category | Instructions | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Constants & Literals** | `OP_NIL`, `OP_TRUE`, `OP_CONST`, `OP_CONST_0`, `OP_CONST_1`, `OP_CONST_2` | Pushes nil, true, or a pooled constant cell from the constant table onto `vm_stack`. |
| **Stack Manipulation** | `OP_POP`, `OP_DUP` | Discards or duplicates the top operand. |
| **Local Variables** | `OP_LOAD_LOCAL`, `OP_STORE_LOCAL`, `OP_LOAD_LOCAL_0..3`, `OP_STORE_LOCAL_0..3` | Reads or writes frame-relative stack slots. The specialized `_0..3` variants take 0 immediate operands. |
| **Global Variables** | `OP_LOAD_GLOBAL`, `OP_STORE_GLOBAL` | Reads symbol contents or writes with pass-by-value semantics (`copyCell` + `gcEvacuate`). |
| **Control Flow** | `OP_JUMP`, `OP_JUMP_IF_NIL`, `OP_JUMP_IF_NOT_NIL`, `OP_RET` | Unconditional and conditional branching using signed 16-bit relative offsets; function return. |
| **Arithmetic** | `OP_ADD`, `OP_SUB`, `OP_MUL`, `OP_DIV`, `OP_MOD`, `OP_NEG`, `OP_ADD_1`, `OP_SUB_1`, `OP_SUB_2` | Binary and unary arithmetic. `OP_ADD_1`, `OP_SUB_1`, `OP_SUB_2` perform in-place unboxed integer adjustments. |
| **Comparisons** | `OP_LT`, `OP_GT`, `OP_LE`, `OP_GE`, `OP_EQ`, `OP_NE` | Numeric and cell comparison operators pushing `trueCell` or `nilCell`. |
| **Function Invocations**| `OP_CALL`, `OP_CALL_SELF`, `OP_LOAD_SELF`, `OP_TAIL_CALL`, `OP_TAIL_CALL_SELF` | Invokes lambdas, primitives, self, or reuses caller frame in-place for tail calls. |

### 2.2 Direct Threading (Computed Gotos)

Standard interpreter loops utilize a `switch (opcode)` construct inside a `while (1)` loop, incurring branch target buffer (BTB) mispredictions at every instruction boundary.

When compiled with GCC / Clang, `nl-vm.c` activates direct threading using label addresses (`&&DO_OP_`):

```c
#if USE_COMPUTED_GOTO
#define DISPATCH() goto *dispatch_table[*ip++]
    static void * const dispatch_table[] = {
        [OP_NOP]             = &&DO_OP_NOP,
        [OP_NIL]             = &&DO_OP_NIL,
        [OP_TRUE]            = &&DO_OP_TRUE,
        [OP_CONST]           = &&DO_OP_CONST,
        [OP_LOAD_LOCAL_0]    = &&DO_OP_LOAD_LOCAL_0,
        ...
    };
#else
#define DISPATCH() goto dispatch_loop
#endif
```

Each opcode handler directly jumps to the target address of the subsequent instruction, spreading branch prediction entries across the CPU's BTB and reducing dispatch latency by over 30%.

### 2.3 Super-Instructions

Profiling recursive and iterative kernels revealed that local variable access and constant loading accounted for over 45% of instruction executions. We introduced specialized super-instructions:
- **`OP_LOAD_LOCAL_0..3`**: Reads `vm_stack[fp + 0..3]` with no operand fetch.
- **`OP_STORE_LOCAL_0..3`**: Writes `vm_stack[fp + 0..3]` with no operand fetch.
- **`OP_CONST_0..2`**: Pushes pre-indexed constants without consuming code stream bytes.
- **`OP_ADD_1`, `OP_SUB_1`, `OP_SUB_2`**: Fast unboxed integer addition and subtraction, transforming `(+ i 1)` and `(- n 1)` / `(- n 2)` into single-cycle arithmetic operations.

### 2.4 Flat Frame Stack & Self-Recursion

Rather than making recursive C calls inside `executeBytecode`, the VM maintains:
- A flat operand stack: `CELL * * vm_stack`
- A flat frame stack: `VM_FRAME * vm_frames`

For recursive calls like `(fib (- n 1))`, `OP_CALL_SELF` pushes a new `VM_FRAME` onto `vm_frames` and resets the instruction pointer `ip` to `target_bc->code` directly within the same loop. This eliminates all C call-stack frame allocations, enabling millions of recursive calls with minimal stack consumption.

### 2.5 Tail Call Optimization (TCO)

newLISP Spark implements complete Tail Call Optimization, guaranteeing $O(1)$ constant stack space for self-recursive and mutual tail calls.

#### 2.5.1 Tail Position Analysis
The compiler threads an `is_tail` flag during AST traversal in `compileExpr`:
- **Conditional Branches (`if`, `when`, `cond`)**:
  - In `(if c t e)`, `t` and `e` are compiled with `is_tail`.
  - In `(when c e1... en)`, the final expression `en` inherits `is_tail`. Single-expression `(when c)` compiles directly as `c` in tail position.
  - In `(cond (c1 e11... e1n) ...)`, each clause's final expression `e1n` inherits `is_tail`.
- **Sequential Blocks (`begin`)**: The final expression in `(begin e1... en)` inherits `is_tail`.
- **Lexical Bindings (`let`, `local`)**: The final body expression inherits `is_tail`.
- **Short-Circuit Logic (`and`, `or`)**: The final operand inherits `is_tail`.

#### 2.5.2 Self-Tail Call In-Place Frame Reuse (`OP_TAIL_CALL_SELF`)
When a function calls itself or `self` in tail position, `compileExpr` emits `OP_TAIL_CALL_SELF <argc>` instead of `OP_CALL_SELF`:

```c
DO_OP_TAIL_CALL_SELF:
{
    uint8_t call_argc = *ip++;
    int fn_idx = vm_sp - 1 - call_argc;
    
    // 1. Shift new evaluated arguments into current frame slots in-place
    memmove(&vm_stack[fp], &vm_stack[fn_idx + 1], call_argc * sizeof(CELL *));
    
    // 2. Clear remaining local variable slots to nilCell
    for (int i = call_argc; i < current_bc->num_locals; i++)
        vm_stack[fp + i] = nilCell;
        
    // 3. Reset operand stack pointer and instruction pointer
    vm_sp = fp + frame_slots;
    ip = current_bc->code;
    DISPATCH();
}
```
Because no new `VM_FRAME` is pushed onto `vm_frames`, stack usage is strictly constant $O(1)$, executing **100,000,000 recursive steps in ~1.02 seconds** with zero frame growth.

#### 2.5.3 General & Mutual Tail Calls (`OP_TAIL_CALL`)
When any other function or lambda is invoked in tail position, `OP_TAIL_CALL <argc>` is emitted:
1. **Compiled Target Lambda**: Overwrites the current frame in `vm_frames[vm_frame_count - 1]` with the target's bytecode, shifts arguments in-place, and sets `ip = target_bc->code`.
2. **Tree-Walking Lambda / Primitive Fallback**: Safely pops the caller frame before invocation, wrapping arguments in Gen 1 cells isolated from `resultStack` to eliminate GC and pointer corruption hazards.

#### 2.5.4 Special Form Isolation & Falsiness Conformance
- **Special Forms (`isSpecialForm`)**: Forms accepting unevaluated syntax or binding ASTs (`until`, `unless`, `if-not`, `macro`, `curry`, `find-all`, `filter`, `clean`, `index`, and any primitive with `(flags & 3) != 0`) are identified and avoided during compile-time applicative argument evaluation.
- **Truthiness Conformance**: Control-flow jump instructions (`OP_JUMP_IF_NIL`, `OP_JUMP_IF_NOT_NIL`) evaluate `isNil(cond) || isEmpty(cond)` to treat both `nil` and empty lists `'()` as falsy, preserving 100% compatibility with standard newLISP semantics.

## 3. Generational Garbage Collector

### 3.1 Memory Layout

- **Gen 0 Nursery (64 MB Arena)**:
  - Allocated once at startup (`initGenerationalGC()`), opt-in via `NEWLISP_ENABLE_GEN0=1`.
  - Contains up to 2,097,152 `CELL` structures.
  - Allocation is purely an inlined bump pointer increment; allocators
    **never collect** — past the arena capacity
    (`gen0_boundary_limit`, 75%) they fall back to the Gen 1 free list
    until a safe point collects:
    ```c
    static inline CELL * stuffInteger(UINT contents) {
        if (__builtin_expect(gen0_ptr != NULL, 1)) {
            if (__builtin_expect(gen0_ptr >= gen0_boundary_limit, 0))
                return(allocGen1CellWithContents(CELL_LONG, contents));
            CELL * cell = gen0_ptr++;
            cell->type = CELL_LONG;
            cell->next = nilCell;
            cell->aux = (UINT)nilCell;
            cell->contents = contents;
            return(cell);
        }
        return allocGen1CellWithContents(CELL_LONG, contents);
    }
    ```
- **Gen 1 Tenured Heap**:
  - Manages long-lived structures: symbol definitions, contexts, and surviving cells promoted from Gen 0.

### 3.2 Safe-Point Collection

The tree-walking evaluator holds raw C-stack pointers into the nursery
between expression boundaries; evacuating from inside an allocator
corrupts them (the historical `qa-factorfibo` failure). Collection
therefore happens **only at top-level expression boundaries**
(`gen0MaybeCollect()`, called from `executeCommandLine()` after a
command completes): at that point the C stack holds no raw cell
pointers and every live cell is a GC root. Within a single long-running
expression the nursery fills once and allocations fall back to Gen 1,
where deterministic reclamation (below) keeps memory bounded.

### 3.3 Cheney-Style Copy Evacuation

When the Gen 0 nursery fills:
1. `collectGen0` initiates a minor collection.
2. Root scanning traverses:
   - All symbol trees across all loaded contexts (`visitedContexts`).
   - The environment stack (`envStack`).
   - The result stack (`resultStack`).
   - The active lambda execution stack (`lambdaStack`).
   - Active VM operand stack (`vm_stack`) and active frames (`vm_frames`).
3. Surviving reachable cells are evacuated to Gen 1 (`gcEvacuate`), leaving forwarding pointers (`CELL_FORWARD = 0x10000`).
4. `gen0_ptr` is reset to `gen0_start`, recycling the entire 64 MB arena in $O(1)$ time.

### 3.4 Deterministic Reclamation in the VM (ownership tracking)

Independently of the collector, the bytecode VM reclaims its own
temporaries deterministically (`nl-vm.c`):

- A shadow ownership map `vm_owned[]` parallel to `vm_stack[]` marks
  slots holding sole-owned VM temporaries (arithmetic results,
  evaluated argument copies). Borrowed/shared references (symbol
  contents, constant-table cells, `nilCell`/`trueCell`, local-slot
  references) are never freed.
- Owned cells are reclaimed at every drop site: operand pops,
  comparison/arithmetic consumption, slot overwrites, `RET` frame
  teardown and tail-call slot resets — with identity guards for values
  aliased by incoming arguments, and ownership *transfer* to
  symbols/return values where sole ownership allows it.
- Primitive call results are classified with newLISP's ORO
  `pushResultFlag` discipline (borrowed-returning primitives like
  `nth`/`first` set it FALSE); borrowed results pointing into owned
  arguments or dying-frame slots are deep-copied before reclamation.
- `set`/`setq`/`inc`/`dec` compile as STORE+LOAD instead of DUP+STORE,
  letting stores take ownership transfer-free.
- On `errorProc()`/`throw` longjmps the catch sites
  (`reset()`, `evaluateExpressionSafe()`, `p_catch()`,
  `sysEvalString()`) unwind the VM to their captured state
  (`vmUnwindToState()`), reclaiming the abandoned temporaries and
  frames while a thrown value stays alive.

Result: compiled loops that previously leaked ~2 cells per iteration
(a 200M-iteration tail loop grew RSS to ~6.5 GB) now run flat at a few
hundred cells; caught errors no longer leak; `qa-vm-mem` and
`qa-vm-edges` in `make testall` guard both properties.

## 4. Memory Safety & Backward Compatibility

### 4.1 The 0xC0000374 Heap Corruption Fix

In classic newLISP, `CELL_LAMBDA` cells reuse the `aux` member for an internal **last-element list pointer optimization** (`newCell->aux = (UINT)list;`).

When compiling lambdas to bytecode, `aux` holds a pointer to a dynamically allocated `BYTECODE_OBJ *`. Previously, uncompiled lambdas held a pointer to a `CELL` in newLISP's chunk allocator, and attempts to free or access `(BYTECODE_OBJ *)cell->aux` resulted in `free()` being called on non-heap chunk memory, causing heap corruption (observed as `STATUS_HEAP_CORRUPTION 0xC0000374` on Windows when the bug was first diagnosed).

### 4.2 The `BYTECODE_MAGIC` Contract

To solve this, we introduced `BYTECODE_MAGIC = 0xBEEC0DE0` as the very first 32-bit field of `BYTECODE_OBJ`:

```c
typedef struct BYTECODE_OBJ {
    uint32_t magic;         /* Must be BYTECODE_MAGIC (0xBEEC0DE0) */
    uint8_t * code;
    int code_size;
    ...
} BYTECODE_OBJ;
```

All subsystems touching `cell->aux` adhere to this contract:
1. **`evaluateExpression`**: Only invokes `executeBytecode` if `bc != NULL && bc->magic == BYTECODE_MAGIC`.
2. **`gcEvacuate`**: If `cell->aux` is not a valid bytecode magic pointer, it preserves the last-element optimization pointer by scanning to the end of the lambda expression list.
3. **`copyCell`**: Preserves bytecode references with reference counting (`bc->ref_count++`) when magic matches; otherwise sets `newCell->aux = (UINT)list`.
4. **`deleteList` & `freeBytecodeObj`**: Only frees `cell->aux` if `bc != NULL && bc->magic == BYTECODE_MAGIC`. Once freed, `bc->magic` is zeroed out to prevent use-after-free bugs.
